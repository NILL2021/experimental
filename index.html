Welcome to our official website. After months of deciding on designs, we have finished and we will stick with this design for a while! We hope you enjoy our remastered website.
                    <br>
                    An archived version of the old website will be released soon. Stay tuned!

                           Welcome to AspectOS, an operating system created by Aspect Inc. We are glad you are here! We are here to tell you about our goal! Our goal is to create a smooth, modern OS that will beat the current competition. Now, we aren't here to compete. We are here to create a new future.
                            <br>
                            One problem we had in the past was that there were too many contributors at once, creating the same things and causing trouble. In our new mission, we limit contributors and we try our best to sort tasks and launch them so everybody has something to do.
                            <br>
                            We overachieved for v1.0 and we screwed up, a lot. But for v2.0, things will be different. We won't have fighting, we will have better features, and we won't be rushed. We will try our best to create a high-quality OS and not just release versions every two weeks. We follow the saying "Quality over Quantity" because that is what describes us
                            <br>
                            And you can help too. You can help start a new future of operating systems. The future starts here.
                        </p>
